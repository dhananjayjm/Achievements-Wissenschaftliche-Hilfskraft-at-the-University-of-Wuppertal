**I have worked as a Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft at the University of Wuppertal. work in the domain of Natural Language Processing, text mining, and Mathematical Information Retrieval. 
I was actively involved as a HiWi in tasks in above mentioned domain.
I like to describe them in two phases,**

## Phase I

**Prof. Wolfgang Wagner**
- Field: Experimental elementary particle physics
- Affiliation: University of Wuppertal (October 2020 - September 2021)
- Accomplishments:
  - Developed technical data tables for arXiv publications into YAML format.
  - These tables can be individually used for further data processing.  
- Relevant Links:
  - [hepdata.net - 7 TeV Data](https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1303905) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dhananjayjm/top-quark-7-TeV))
  - [hepdata.net - 8 TeV Data](https://www.hepdata.net/record/82544) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dhananjayjm/top-quark-8TeV))
  - Conducted a study of a Monte Carlo event generator.

## Phase II

**Prof. Bela Gipp**
- Field: Data and Knowledge Engineering
- Affiliation: University of Wuppertal (Current Affiliation **Georg-August-Universität Göttingen**)
   (December 2020 - June 2022)

- Supervisors: Mr. Philipp Scharpf and Dr. Corinna Breitinger
- Accomplishments:
  - Transferred annotations to the Wikipedia Entity Linking formulae in Wikipedia articles to Wikidata items, corresponding `<math>` tag QID attributes.
  - Added a seeding list for GoldID to MathMLBen ([mathmlben.wmflabs.org](https://mathmlben.wmflabs.org/)) like semantic $\LaTeX$ input.
  - Studied the fundamentals of *PyWikibot* and attempted to write a *PyWikibot* script to seed formulae with identifier semantics to Wikidata.
  - Learned to develop *SPARQL* queries to retrieve formulae with specific identifier semantics.
  - Wrote a Python script for the extraction of identifier symbols, names, and QIDs from the seeding list *MathMLBen* semantic $\TeX$ strings.
  - Evaluated the performance of `LaTeXtoSymPy` for *MathMLBen*.
  - Wrote a Python code using the **Selenium web driver** to automate adding 'wikidata items.'
  - Evaluated Entity Linking prediction on a selected article from *arXiv corpus ([0705.3017] Vortex in axion condensate as a dark matter halo)*.
  - Evaluated (SPARQL and Pywikibot) QID predictions for "Math Entity Linking" **zbMATH** keywords.
  - Calculated *precision* and *recall* for textual entity linking and discounted cumulative gain for mathematical entity linking.
  - Completed an extensive literature review of several research articles for 'Named Entity Linking' and 'Math Entity Linking' to Wikipedia, knowledge graphs, data sets, and databases.
  - Completed a comprehensive literature review of several research articles from 2014 to 2021 based on **'research paper recommendation'** and **'citation recommendation'** systems. This task mainly includes statistical interpretations of various attributes like keywords, recommendation class, approaches named, evaluation and data sets, recommendation class, number of citations, etc.
